# Debugging Roadmap: react-shopping-cart

## Bug Categories & Analysis

### 1. React Anti-patterns & State Management Issues
- Direct state mutation: Ensure all state updates are immutable (use spread/rest, map, filter).
- Improper context usage: Avoid using context for rapidly changing values; modularize context if it grows too large.
- Incorrect/missing dependency arrays: All hooks (useEffect, useCallback, useMemo) must have correct dependencies.
- Non-memoized callbacks/components: Use useCallback and React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
- Global state bloat: Consider modularizing or using a state management library if context grows too large.

### 2. Performance Bottlenecks & Optimization Opportunities
- Expensive filtering/sorting: Use useMemo for derived data (e.g., filtered products).
- Unnecessary re-renders: Use React.memo for pure components and memoize props.
- Large component trees: Split large components into smaller, focused ones.
- Inefficient list rendering: Use keys properly, avoid inline functions/objects in render, and consider virtualization for large lists.
- Network request duplication: Debounce or throttle user-triggered API calls.

### 3. Error Handling Gaps & Edge Cases
- API error handling: Ensure all API calls have try-catch, user-friendly error messages, and retry logic.
- Loading and empty states: Always show loading indicators and handle empty data gracefully.
- Edge cases: Handle cases like no products, network failures, and invalid user actions (e.g., adding out-of-stock items).

### 4. Security Vulnerabilities
- XSS via dangerouslySetInnerHTML: Avoid unless sanitized; use JSX for static content.
- Open redirects/tabnabbing: All external links should use rel="noopener noreferrer" and target="_blank".
- Unvalidated image sources: Only use trusted/static image URLs.
- Sensitive data exposure: Never log or expose sensitive user data.

### 5. Code Quality & Maintainability Issues
- Inconsistent naming and structure: Use clear, consistent naming and folder structure.
- Lack of types: Ensure all functions/components are properly typed (TypeScript).
- Missing tests: Add/expand unit and integration tests.
- Dead code: Remove unused files, variables, and imports.
- Documentation: Ensure README and inline comments are up to date.

## Priority Assessment
- **Critical:** State mutation bugs, missing error handling, broken product/cart flows, XSS vulnerabilities.
- **High-impact:** Performance bottlenecks in product filtering, unnecessary re-renders, missing loading/error states.
- **Security:** Any use of unsanitized HTML, unsafe links, or unvalidated external resources.
- **UX:** Poor feedback on errors/loading, confusing navigation, or broken UI on edge cases.

---

## 7-Day Debugging Roadmap

### Day 1: State Management & React Anti-patterns
- Audit all state updates for immutability.
- Refactor any direct mutations (use spread/rest, map, filter).
- Review all context usage; modularize if needed.
- Fix missing/incorrect dependency arrays in hooks.
- Memoize callbacks and pure components.

**Testing:**
- Unit tests for reducers and state updates.
- Use React DevTools to inspect re-renders.

---

### Day 2: Performance Optimization
- Profile with React DevTools Profiler.
- Memoize expensive computations with useMemo.
- Use React.memo for presentational components.
- Optimize list rendering (keys, avoid inline functions).
- Debounce/throttle API calls if needed.

**Testing:**
- Measure before/after render times.
- Test with large product lists.

---

### Day 3: Error Handling & Edge Cases
- Wrap all API calls in try-catch.
- Add user-friendly error messages and retry logic.
- Implement loading and empty states for all async data.
- Handle edge cases (no products, network down, etc.).

**Testing:**
- Simulate API failures and slow networks.
- Test all user flows for error/empty/loading states.

---

### Day 4: Security Hardening
- Remove/replace all dangerouslySetInnerHTML with JSX or sanitized HTML.
- Add rel="noopener noreferrer" and target="_blank" to all external links.
- Validate all image sources.
- Review for any sensitive data exposure.

**Testing:**
- Use security linters (e.g., eslint-plugin-security).
- Manual XSS and open redirect testing.

---

### Day 5: Code Quality & Maintainability
- Refactor for consistent naming and structure.
- Add/expand TypeScript types.
- Remove dead code and unused dependencies.
- Improve inline documentation and README.

**Testing:**
- Run linter and type checker.
- Peer review for code clarity.

---

### Day 6: Testing & Advanced Debugging
- Expand unit and integration tests (Jest, React Testing Library).
- Add tests for error boundaries and edge cases.
- Test cart/product flows end-to-end.

**Testing:**
- Run all tests, ensure high coverage.
- Manual exploratory testing.

---

### Day 7: Production Readiness & Monitoring
- Add runtime error monitoring (e.g., Sentry).
- Set up performance monitoring (e.g., Lighthouse, Web Vitals).
- Review and finalize deployment scripts.
- Document all fixes and improvements.

**Testing:**
- Deploy to staging, run smoke tests.
- Monitor logs and error reports.

---

## Debugging Strategy
- **Systematic:** Tackle one category per day, using code search, static analysis, and runtime profiling.
- **Testing:** Write/expand tests for each fix; use mocks for API failures and edge cases.
- **Monitoring:** Add runtime error and performance monitoring; set up alerts for regressions.

---

## Core Bug Fixes: State & Performance
- **State:** Refactor all state updates to be immutable; modularize context.
- **Performance:** Memoize expensive computations, optimize rendering, and profile regularly.

---

## Advanced Debugging: Error Handling, Security, Testing
- **Error Handling:** Add try-catch, user feedback, and retries for all async flows.
- **Security:** Remove unsafe HTML, validate all external resources, and secure navigation.
- **Testing:** Expand coverage, especially for edge cases and error boundaries.

---

## Production Readiness
- **Monitoring:** Integrate Sentry or similar for error tracking.
- **Documentation:** Update README, add inline docs for complex logic.
- **Deployment:** Ensure build scripts are robust and environment variables are secure.
